Technical Specification: Tetris Game in Java
Project Title:
Tetris Classic — Lightweight Java Implementation

Objective:
Develop a compact, portable version of the classic Tetris game using pure Java, without external game engines or libraries. The game should run as a standalone .jar file and be compatible with major desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Technology Stack
Language: Java (JDK 8+)
GUI Toolkit: javax.swing
Graphics: java.awt.Graphics, java.awt.Color, java.awt.event
Build Tool: Manual compilation via javac or optional use of Maven/Gradle for packaging
Functional Requirements
1. Game Window
Fixed-size window (e.g., 400x800 pixels)
Title: "Tetris Classic"
Non-resizable
Close button exits the game
2. Game Board
Grid size: 10 columns × 20 rows
Each cell is a square (e.g., 40x40 pixels)
Background color and grid lines for visual clarity
3. Tetrominoes
7 standard shapes: I, O, T, S, Z, J, L
Each shape has a color
Rotation logic (clockwise only)
Spawn at the top center of the board
4. Game Mechanics
Gravity: pieces fall at a fixed interval (adjustable by level)
Collision detection: prevent movement through walls or other blocks
Line clearing: remove full rows and shift above rows down
Scoring system:
1 line: 100 points
2 lines: 300 points
3 lines: 500 points
4 lines (Tetris): 800 points
Level progression: increase speed every 10 lines cleared
5. User Input
Arrow keys:
Left/Right: move piece
Down: soft drop
Spacebar: hard drop
Up arrow: rotate piece
P: pause/resume
R: restart game
6. Game Over
Triggered when new piece cannot spawn
Display "Game Over" message
Option to restart or exit
Non-Functional Requirements
Portability: Runs on any OS with Java installed
Performance: Smooth rendering and input handling
Packaging: Single executable .jar file
Code Quality: Modular, readable, and well-commented code
Suggested Class Structure
Class Name	Responsibility
Main	Entry point, initializes game
GamePanel	Main canvas, handles rendering and game loop
Board	Stores grid state, line clearing logic
Tetromino	Shape definitions, rotation, movement
InputHandler	Key bindings and input processing
GameState	Score, level, pause, game over flags
Optional Features
Sound effects (using javax.sound.sampled)
High score saving (simple file I/O)
Preview of next piece
Hold piece functionality
